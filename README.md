🚢 Maritime Passenger Survival Dashboard:

This Power BI project analyzes survival patterns aboard a simulated maritime voyage, inspired by the Titanic. It explores how factors like class, age, gender, fare, and cabin location influenced survival outcomes. Using interactive visuals and data modeling, the dashboard highlights key insights with real-world relevance for emergency preparedness.

📊 Dashboard Overview:

-> This dashboard presents detailed visualizations on:

-> Passenger class distribution and survival outcomes

-> Age group trends: children, teens, adults, elderly

-> Gender-based survival patterns

-> Impact of cabin assignment and overcrowding

-> Fare vs. likelihood of survival

-> Tool Used: Power BI
-> Techniques: DAX, custom measures, data transformation

🎯 Why This Matters:

The dashboard uncovers structural and demographic factors that influenced survival. These insights can guide improvements in:

🚨 Emergency strategies

⚖️ Class and gender equity

🧓 Demographic risk profiling

🛏️ Cabin safety planning

🔎 Key Findings:

-> Teens showed the highest survival rates across all classes.

-> Unspecified cabins were common and linked to poor evacuation outcomes.

-> Overcrowded cabins like G6, C85, and E46 reduced survival chances.

-> Elderly passengers consistently had the lowest survival rates.

-> Fare price had no clear impact on survival, showing systemic flaws in cabin allocation and emergency planning.

📌 Recommendations:

Smart Cabin Allocation:
-> Avoid overcrowding by assigning cabins based on age, mobility, and group size.

Special Safety Zones:
-> Create designated zones for children, elderly, and teens near exits with staff support.

Technology for Safety:
-> Use smart wristbands for evacuation guidance and real-time passenger tracking.

Targeted Safety Training:
-> Implement age-appropriate drills and gender-sensitive communication strategies.

Upper-Class Safety Protocols:
-> Assign trained staff and mark exclusive evacuation routes in premium cabins.

🧰 Getting Started:

-> Download a Titanic-style dataset (e.g., from Kaggle).

-> Load it into Power BI and clean the data.

-> Apply custom DAX formulas and filters.

-> Build visuals and explore metrics:

-> Survival by class and gender

-> Age group trends

-> Cabin occupancy effects

-> Fare analysis and crowding
