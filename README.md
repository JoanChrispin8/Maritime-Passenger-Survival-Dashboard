🚢 Titanic Survival Dashboard:

This project analyzes survival patterns aboard the Titanic using Power BI.
It explores how class, age, gender, fare, and cabin location influenced survival outcomes.
The dashboard turns historical data into visual insights to highlight key survival patterns and systemic issues in evacuation.

🖼️ Dashboard Preview:
[Insert Screenshot_1: Full Dashboard Overview]

📊 Dashboard Features:

-> Passenger Class & Survival Rates

-> Age Group Trends: Children, Teens, Adults, Elderly

-> Gender-based Survival

-> Cabin Crowding (G6, E46, C85, Unspecified)

-> Fare vs. Survival Likelihood

-> Interactive Slicers & KPIs

Tools Used:

-> Power BI

-> DAX formulas, calculated columns, data modeling

🎯 Why This Project Matters:

This dashboard visualizes how demographic and structural factors influenced Titanic survival outcomes.
The findings can support improved planning in transportation and emergency response today.

Key Benefits:

-> Spot vulnerable groups (elderly, children)

-> Detect issues in cabin overcrowding

-> Challenge assumptions about class and gender roles in emergencies

🔍 Key Findings (Sample Visuals):

[Insert Screenshot_5: Fare Amount vs. Survival]

-> Teens consistently had highest survival rates

-> Unspecified cabins and overcrowding were common in all classes

-> Fare paid did not strongly influence survival outcomes

-> Elderly passengers were at the highest risk

-> Upper class survival was not guaranteed, showing evacuation was not well-managed even for premium passengers
